# Mini Project - Advanced Data Science Course at BIU

## Description
This project includes two main tasks:
1. Covariance and Correlation Analysis with the Iris Dataset.
2. Laptop Price Analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Visualization Libraries.

## Features
- Implement covariance and correlation calculations from scratch.
- Validate results with NumPy and visualize them.
- Analyze and visualize laptop pricing trends by brand, RAM, CPU, and storage.

## **Install Dependencies**
These are the required packages needed for the project to run.
**Note, create a virtual environment** first to install all the requirements
Since this project was done with a MacBook, here are the steps to create a virtual environment, and activate it

**Step 1:** Create a Virtual Environment called 'venv_name', you can change the name to any name, the name I used is venv

`python3 -m venv venv_name`

**Step 2:** Activate your virtual environment

```python
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

To know your virtual environment has been activated, the name of your virtual environment comes up as a prefix in your terminal
After activating the virtual environment, you can now install these packages

**Step 3:** To install these packages, run the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
Datasets used in this notebook are the iris dataset and laptop price dataset which are included in the folder "**Dataset**"

## Detailed Documentation and Analysis
The documentation and detailed explanation of the analysis are found in the pdf titled "Mini Project-Folasewa-B02294068.pdf"

## Ipynb Notebook
The jupyter notebook is titled **"Mini_Project_Folasewa_DS.ipynb"**
